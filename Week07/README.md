# Midterm Project/Presentations: Due Thursday October 17

Today you will present your "new" application. Be sure to describe a more specific use case for your app. Any new functionality should be described as a user story. That user story should inform what field(s) needs to be added to your forms.

Midterm Project/Presenatation checklist:
_I highly recommend making a slide deck for your presentation_

- [ ] 1-3 sentence elevator pitch of what your application is/who it is for.

- [ ] User story that includes your new field aka new app functionality.

- [ ] A developer checklist (written before your start)

- [ ] A revised checklist of what you actually had to do to implement it. Did you initially forget something critical?

- [ ] Live demo of your App. Your app should be styled for mobile devices. Please use the responsive function in google developer tools when you present or resize your browser to a smaller portrait oriented size.

- [ ] Code walkthrough. Take us through the new field you added, how you added it, and how it contributes to your User Story.
