- Make sure you have all software set up for next class.

- Practice creating a new react project, editing the starter files, and creating components using JSX and loading content from data. This part of the HW will make more sense after we complete Thursdays class.

Use `git add` `git commit` and `git push` to upload these folders and files to Github, just like we did in class today.

**Reminder: Documentation is 5% of your grade at IDM. A clean repo with detailed markdown files and commented code is an easy way to achieve this!**
