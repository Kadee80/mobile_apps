# HW Week04:

Next week we will take a look at the classic `To Do List` project. This, or something similar to it will most likely wind up in any coding test you are asked to perform in a React Dev job interview. We will explore 3 different solutions to the same problem.

We are already in Week 4! Which means Midterms are approaching soon. For now, start thinking about a User Story for a more specialized ToDo List app. What might an extra feature/functionality in your ToDoList app involve? Is your target user a student? A doctor? An farmer? What additional feature might you add to make this App more tailored to your target group?

Create a MarkDown file and write about your initial ideas. Your ideas may change once we start coding next week. That's fine. This is just the initial exercise.
