# Homework Due Thursday Week06

This week we will build the classic `ToDoList` app. Unlike past lessons, we will build the same app, 3 different ways. By the second refactor, we will have covered some exiting new topics, and tackled our largest project yet!

Your midterm project and presentation will involve adding a target audience and user story for this app. Is your final ToDo List for a book club? For grocery shopping? For someone recovering from the hospital?

Last week's HW was to start thinking about your target use case. With that user story in mind, start adding CSS to the fully functioning, yet unstyled ToDo List app. Remember, this class is called Mobile Apps. So please make the default styling for phone and/or tablet.
