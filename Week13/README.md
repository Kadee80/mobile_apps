# Final Project/Presentations: Due Thursday December 12

You now have fully functioning C.R.U.D. native app code. Next week we will
explore adding in data persistence with a JSON server database. With these starter files, you have all of the logic you need to start expanding (by adding fields, screens, components) your application to a more specific use case. Your final project requirements are basically identical to your midterm project requirements. In short, turn the app we built in class into a portfolio worthy more specialized application.

Note: Your final project code should absolutley require some additions and modifications to your Context code, including your reducer. You are more than welcome to explore adding in the usage of a free external API of your choice (google translate etc...).

When you present your "new" application on Dec 12, be sure to describe a more specific use case for your app. Any new functionality should be described as a user story. That user story should inform what field(s) needs to be added to your forms.

Project/Presenatation checklist:
_I highly recommend making a slide deck for your presentation_

- [ ] 1-3 sentence elevator pitch of what your application is/who it is for.

- [ ] User story that includes your new field aka new app functionality.

- [ ] A developer checklist (written before your start)

- [ ] A revised checklist of what you actually had to do to implement it. Did you initially forget something critical?

- [ ] Live demo of your App. Your app should be styled for mobile devices. Please use the responsive function in google developer tools when you present or resize your browser to a smaller portrait oriented size.

- [ ] Code walkthrough. Take us through the new fields/functionality you added, how you added it, and how it contributes to your User Story.
