# HW Week10

It's already Week10! Time to start thinking about your final projects! Throughout the next few classes we will be covering the following in this order:

- Creating a new app project, including navigation dependencies from scratch.
- Using an external API.
- Advanced Navigation (parameters)
- Context in React Native
- Exercise Route recorder with MongoDB and Express API
- In App Auth

I will be asking you to present your final project ideas soon, but first I would like to see how far we get in this Thursdays class before chosing a presentation date.
